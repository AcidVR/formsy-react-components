# formsy-react-components

This package provides a selection of components that render form elements for use within a [formsy-react](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react) form.

By default, the element is wrapped with tags that provide the boilerplate to help include it in a [Bootstrap form](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms). This includes a `<label>`, [help text](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-help-text), and some [validation styling](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-validation) tied to formsyâ€™s validation state and validation messages.

## Documentation

None yet! Best bet for now is to examine the [source](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/blob/gh-pages/playground/app.js) for the [Playground](http://twisty.github.io/formsy-react-components/playground/).
